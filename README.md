# Fuzzy Representation Learning  
This work is inspired from [Fuzzy Representation Learning](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10061283). Although it is not a implementation of the exact same code, but this helped me a lot to visualize my own layer.

The Fuzzy layer can be broken down into two parts, Antecedent and Consequent. Their Functional Overview is described in the following flowcharts.
